# Tinos Transparency — agent brief

Read these two files before doing anything in this repo:

- `FINDINGS.md` — the VERIFIED API contract. Non-negotiable. In particular:
  Diavgeia silently drops unknown parameters and silently clamps issueDate to
  ~180 days, always returning HTTP 200. Never trust a response without
  checking `info.query`. Getting this wrong produces plausible, wrong numbers.
- `PROMPT.md` — the project brief: goals, data model, invariants, privacy rules.

## Hard invariants
- `data/raw/` is append-only. Never edit or delete a file there.
- Every derived figure must trace to a stored document hash.
- Never sum Diavgeia amounts naively — the same euro appears 3-4 times.
- Payroll beneficiaries are absent BY DESIGN. Do not try to recover them.
- Be polite to public endpoints: keep the delay, keep the User-Agent.
- The GitHub repo is public: every tracked file is published. `tinos
  privacy-check` must pass before any push (PRIVACY.md Q1).

## Current state
Phase 1 done: Diavgeia ingester (`tinos backfill`), full corpus in `data/raw`
(76,785 acts, 11 entities, 2010-2026). Phase 2 done: curated layer
(`tinos build` -> `data/curated/*.parquet`, `tinos release` ->
`releases/tinos.duckdb`, `tinos summary` -> `SUMMARY.md`). Read the
docstring of `src/tinos/curated.py` before touching any money figure: it
lists the flags (remittance, suspect, reversal, payroll kinds) and why.
Next: ΚΗΜΔΗΣ ingester for awards from 2021 on; execution-statement PDFs.
